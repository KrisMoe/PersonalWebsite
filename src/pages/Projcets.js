We were required to create a program that calculated and output the results from an election based on a CSV file with information about the election. The project was separated into two parts, One where our team worked using the waterfall method and on using the Agile Scrum. To ensure that our program worked we used the google test suite to test our program. ",

The hardest part of this project was creating all the tests to ensure that our project worked. Our group was able to leverage our strengths to work very efficiently.  "

I also believe that this project is expandable, and that I was able to complete a project without suffering significant feature creep.  "
